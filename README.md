This project is using React and Node, so before getting started you will need to see if Node is installed.
To figure that out, go to your command prompt and type

`npm`

If you receive any type of error stating that `npm` does not exist, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Once Node is installed you'll be able to run the project pretty simply.

## Step 1 - Clone the project

1. Click the Clone or download button
2. Copy the repo link that appears
3. In a command prompt type `git clone https://github.com/lewing728/meyer-application.git`

## Step 2 - Install the packages

In you command prompt, type `npm install` (this may take awhile)

## Step 3 - Run the project

In your command prompt, type `npm start` and it should open in a browser window.

Let me know if you have any issues!!!
